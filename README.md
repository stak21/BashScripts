when you are running nr | you will be asked for title, description and number of tasks
So you will want to | copy and paste the title, copy and paste !!!ONLY the bullet points and if there are different sections copy and paste the first section and copy and paste the other parts afterwards
after that you can either just type in the task names, or | if you know the answers, you can type in the answers too and this will create a table for you.
You can now commit it | or if you made a mistake you can delete the whole thing and start over
So enjoy and thank you~ I hope this works | Easy coding~
