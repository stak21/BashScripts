## Description

This project in the System engineering & DevOps series is about:
This is a little example of what this baby can do~
!! This is a fun little thing I worked on, but its still easy to make your own readme without it. And could be faster? So if you find this script slower than you would be able to make it yourself! don't bother~
For those of you who don't have a template for a README and a lot of people suggest
keeping you README organize, this is great for you (although it is a lot more wwork if you want your README to be a couple lines)

Shoutout to Victor nguyen for giving us advice and letting me use his template, so basically it goes like this.
Title
Description
task|answer
and my script will
let you copy and paste the title
copy and paste the description
and go thorugh the task one by and giving the answer if you want.

To use this ... go to your home directory and open .profile in your editor. copy and paste the code to the very and save/exit

type in the terminal source ~/.profile (this will I think update the funcitons in there)
When you create your repository or folder for the next project, type nr in the directory and go through the interactive guide to creating a clean README

Example: 
nr Title name
Type in your description or copy and paste and press enter
ctrl+d to tell the program to stop
type 1 to type the task only or 2 to type both task and answer at the same time
after that it will ask you if you want to commit, save and exit, or delete the README

Thats it! If there are any issues then slack me and ill do my best to fix it.
I hope you enjoy! easy coding~
